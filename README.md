This is just the basic Akka tutorial that can be found at http://akka.io/docs/akka/1.1.3/intro/getting-started-first-scala.html#getting-started-first-scala. I made only one simple modification: I broke up the actors into their own files.

I like to use Eclipse so I used https://github.com/typesafehub/sbteclipse/tree/sbt-0.10 to get going, but that isn't necessary.
